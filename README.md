Timeboxxer is an interactive project to implement time blocking functionality in Python. Currently, the application tracks system time and alerts the user at 50, 55, and 60 minutes to change tasks. Useful for anyone who uses time boxing on their calendar but loses track of time.

This project is also Agile and will be evolving with new functions being added. I will be adding a list of future features soon.
